#! /usr/bin/env bash
#
# Name: bash_rsync.sh
#
# Brief: Bash script that uses rsync to backup files from a specific directory  
# on computer to external hard drive, USB drive, etc. 
# - Script includes user prompts, since including or excluding a trailing / 
# is tricky, when entering the source & destination/target.
# - Prevents: Creation of unwanted duplicated sub-directories.
#
# Author: Kim Lew

# For SOURCE: 
# State the specific sub-directory WITHOUT /.
# For DESTINATION (target): 
# Do NOT state specific sub-directory, BUT add a /.

# Note: rsync is smart enough to create the sub-directory, if it doesn't already
# exist, & transfers contents. 
# If sub-directory already exists, rsync just transfers contents.

# Limitation: Only 2 USB ports on laptop.
