## Bash script to sync folders and files on local drive to external hard drive

Name: ```bash_rsync.sh```

Bash script with user prompts so user does not forget what to enter as source 
and destination, since it is a bit tricky. Otherwise, you can easily end up 
with extra directories you did not want.
